# Running this project

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a terminal (mac/linux) or windows terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project

```
virtualenv env
```

That will create a new folder  `env`  in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/linux:

```
source env/bin/active
```

Then install the project dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the project with this command

**Note**  if you want payments or email  or sms   to work you will need to enter your own Stripe API keys into the  `.env`  file in the settings files.
